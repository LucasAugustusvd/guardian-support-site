## Quick Start
1. Allow **Location** and **Notifications** when prompted.
2. Add your phone number and trusted contacts in the app.
3. Press **ALERT** to notify contacts and opted-in nearby users (~250 m).
4. Use the **Heatmap** tab to see recent alert clusters and plan safer routes.

## FAQs

### I didn’t receive a notification from a friend
- Make sure both devices have allowed **Notifications**.  
- Ensure both users added their **phone number** inside the app and completed registration.  
- Contacts must include the correct phone number (country code included, e.g. `+31...`).  
- Nearby alerts only trigger for users who **opt-in** and are within ~250 m at alert time.

### The map didn’t focus when I tapped the notification
Open the app and check the **Nearby** tab—new alerts appear at the top and on the map.  
If you force-quit the app, the deep link might not focus automatically; opening **Nearby** will still show the alert.

### Widget looks blank / “please adopt containerBackground API”
Make sure you’ve installed the latest TestFlight build and granted permissions. iOS may show this on very old iOS versions or during development; on current versions it should render normally.
